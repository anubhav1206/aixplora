AIxplora is an innovative open-source project that introduces a new paradigm in file exploration. Powered by AI and Language Models (LLMs), AIxplora allows you to effortlessly interact with various document types, regardless of their length or format.

**Imagine having the ability to search, analyze, and query PDF files, MP3 audio, videos, and more with equal ease and proficiency. AIxplora opens up a limitless world of possibilities!***

Currently, in our proof-of-concept version (0.0.1), we support PDF files. However, we have exciting plans to expand our file-type compatibility and introduce new features in the near future!
